                                    Scope Functions
 - Kotlin standard library also provides a list of functions whose sole purpose is to execute a block of code in the
    context of an object.
 - This functions form a temporary scope that can be used to manipulate the object.
 - They include
        1. let{}
        2. Also{}
        3. run{}
        4. with{}
        5. apply{}

 - All this functions perform the same action, execute a block of code. The diffrence is how the object appears inside the block
    and the result of the whole expression.
