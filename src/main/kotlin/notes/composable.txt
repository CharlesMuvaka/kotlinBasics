                                JetPack compose Composable
 - Involves defining functions that take in data and emit UI elements.
 - These functions must be annotated with the @Composable annotation.
 - These functions usually return nothing when they are called. They only emit the UI elements.
 - A composable might emit many ui elements, however, if you don't specify how the elements are to be arranged,
    they might be arranged in a way ou don't like. On tp of each other.
 - Example:

    @Composable
    fun greetUser(name: String) {
        Text("Hello")
        Text(name)
    }
        - Without defining how the texts wil be positioned, compose will pile these texts on top of each other.
            Making it hard for the user to read.
        NOTE: To counter this, compose provides a collection of ready to use UI elements to help you arrange your elements.

        Specialized layout components
       1. Row
     - Used to place elements horizontally on the screen.
     Example:

        @Composable
        fun greetUser(name: String){
            Row(takes in parameters to effectively decorate the elements){
                Text("Hello")
                Text(name)
            }
        }

        - The text elements in the above function will be aligned horizontally
                Common row Parameters
             1. verticalAlignment - Used to align the elements either on top of the row, center or at the bottom. Similar to the align-items attribute in css.


        2. Column
      - Used to place elements vertically on the screen.
      Example:

            @Composable
            fun greetUser(name: String){
                Column(takes in parameters to effectively decorate the elements){
                    Text("Hello")
                    Text(name)
                }
            }

            - The text elements in the above function will be aligned vertically.

         3. Box
      - Used to place elements on top of each other.
      Example:

            @Composable
            fun suggestMusic(artist: Artist){
                Box{
                    Image(bitMap = artist.image, contentDescription = "${artist.name} image")
                    Icon(Icons.Filled.check, contentDescription = "Music Icon")
                }
            }

        4. Image
        - There are several ways to define images in our composable.
            1. BitMapImage
            2. VectorImage
        - ImageBitmap are used for storing raster images. These are images that contain resolutions in pixels. A painterResource() is used to load the image in the imageBitmap instance.
        - Vector images are used to load vector assets.
        NOTE: Image() composable is used in both cases specifying your target in the painterResource() instance.
            Example: Image(painter = painterResource(R.drawable.dog, contentDescription = "App logo")

        Why shift from xml based layouts to compose
    1. Reduce the cost of shifting layouts during runtime.

                            Specialized components attributes.
    1. Modifiers
    - They allow you to decorate a composable.
    - You can set up
        1. The height of your UI element.
        2. The width of your UI element.
        3. The back-ground color of your UI element.
        4. The maximum height and width of the UI element.
        5. Adding padding to elements.
        6. Setting the offset of elements( how far the element will be placed from its original position. Similar to border
            though it doesn't push the other elements as border would do.)

            Height and width attributes.
