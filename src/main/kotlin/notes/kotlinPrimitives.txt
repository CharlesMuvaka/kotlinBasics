     1. split() - Groups a string(Character sequence) to a list of strings based on a given regex expression.
     2. subSequence - Returns a new string(Character sequence) starting from the specified start index and ending
                    right before the specified end index.
                    NOTE: This function takes in either one or two parameters
                            1. startIndex - This is a must, it specifies where to start extracting the new string from.
                            2. endIndex - When not specified, the string is extracted to the last index of the original string
                                         - When specified the string extraction ends right before the endIndex
