                        Cloud computing
 - A cloud is a computer stored in a different location that can be accessed via the internet
 - Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of I.T services via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

                        Cloud computing Models
 - there are three types
                1. Infrastructure as a service
 - A vendor rents out the whole server, operating system. The provider has no control over the system once it is
 in your possession
                2. Platform as a service
 - Provision of platforms to the developers that can help them in software development.
 - The owner has control over the system in terms of updates, maintenance and the operating system
                3. Software as a service
 - End users are presented with ready application to use. The Owner is responsible for everything regarding the
  software product.
 - The user is only responsible for using the software as it is.

                      Cloud deployment Models
 - These represent different environments in which you can deploy your applications
 - They consist of three
            1. Cloud - The application is deployed to a remote computer that can only be accessed
                        via the internet
            2. Hybrid - This is a situation where an organisation has a cloud and on premise server.
                       -Deployment can occur in both areas.
            3. An on premise cloud - This is a situation where cloud infrastructure is run on an on premise
                                    data center.
                                    - It is kinda expensive but some organisations require such scenarios.

                       Software Development Life Cycle
 - This is a process used to develop and produce software in an organised and disciplined manner
 - It consists of the following steps
            1. Plan(Problem Statement) - Identifying the problem at hand and resources needed to solve the problem.
            2. Analyze - Stating the results to be gotten from the solution and gathering requirements needed.
            3. Design - Coming up with prototypes and selecting the architecture to be used.
            4. Develop - An appropriate programming language is used to develop the software
            5. Test - Writing code to test the functionality of the software code.
            6. Deploy - Hoisting the ready made software
            7. Maintenance - update and fixing incoming bugs.
