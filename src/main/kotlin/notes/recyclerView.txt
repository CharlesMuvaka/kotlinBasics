- An enhancement of both the list and grid views

        Creating a slider
   -All layout managers have a snackHelper class that helps in animating recyclerView layouts

        helper.attachRecyclerView() // contains a method that can attach a recycler view to it

        -- You can schedule the duration of the sliding effect using a time with its schedule method.
        Timer timer = new Timer()
        timer.schedule(new TimerTask(){
            @Override
            public void run(){
                if(){

                }
            }
        }delay: 0, period: 3000)
