        kotlin - OOP
 - kotlin is both a functional and Object-Oriented Programming language.
 - It expresses its functional nature using functions, lambdas or high order functions
 - It uses classes as an Object-Oriented language

        Classes
  - These are blueprints that define the template of an object.
  - To create a class we use the class Keyword followed by the name of the class.
  - A class contains a header and a body.
  - The header is the declaration and the name of the class.
  -The body is encapsulated in curly braces and contains the member variables and methods of the class.
  - By default a class is public, it can be accessed from outside its package.
  - Example
        class Student{ // class header
            val id: Int
            val name: String // class body
        }
